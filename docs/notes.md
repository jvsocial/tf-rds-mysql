Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).

Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). You must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.

When you create an access key pair, save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key can be retrieved only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must delete the access key and create a new one.

You can have a maximum of two access keys per user.
